/*  Exercise 1-11
    To test the word count program, I would create a series of example files,
    each with a known word count. Some edge cases I would test for are a 
    completely empty file, a file with one word, a file with one space, a 
    file with one tab, two words seperated by multiple white space characters,
    and finally, just for kicks, a wikipedia article. */
